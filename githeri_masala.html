<p>The name Githeri simply means or refers to Succotash in English. Unlike Succotash, it does not include lima beans and uses other types such as Red Kidney, Pinto, or Adzuki beans.</p>
<p>Githeri, also known as mutheri or muthere, is a traditional one-pot meal comprising boiled corn (or maize) and beans, that originated in Central Kenya. It was referred to as the traditional dish of the Kikuyu people in Central Kenya but has since seen its popularity spread to other parts of the country due to its tasty, nutritious, and affordable nature. It is also consumed in other parts of Africa and goes by several names (Adalu in Nigeria, and corn chaff in Cameroon)</p>
