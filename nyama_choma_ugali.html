<h2>How To Make Nyama Choma</h2>
<ol>
    <li>For the nyama choma marinade, blend all ingredients (except the meat) until smooth. If you lack a blender, dice everything finely or use a pestle and mortar. Marinating the meat is an extra step, but it's worth it as it enhances the flavors.</li>
    <li>On a chopping board, make 2-inch (5 cm) slits on the meat.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, coat the meat with the marinade, ensuring the slits are covered. Save some marinade for basting during grilling.</li>
    <li>Cover the meat and allow it to marinate for at least two hours or overnight, for best results .</li>
    <li>Bring meat to room temperature. Preheat the grill to high; if using charcoal, adjust the heat using the ashes.</li>
    <li>Sear meat for 3 minutes per side to get char marks. Place on oiled foil and top with the reserved marinade. Add garlic and rosemary on top, then cover losely with foil.</li>
    <li>Set meat on a water-filled tray and grill under medium-low heat.</li>
    <li>As an optional step, near the end, mix honey and hot water and glaze the meat with it. Continue grilling until cooked through, and the juices run clear.</li>
    <li>Let the meat rest for 10-20 minutes and then server.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Good to know ðŸ’¡: </strong>While traditional nyama choma is typically marinated only in salt, this recipe includes a flavorful blend that enhances the taste. Be aware that some butchers in Kenya and Tanzania may add MSG, a potentially unhealthy preservative. Therefore, it's advisable to inquire about this with your butcher when having meat grilled at their shop.</p>
